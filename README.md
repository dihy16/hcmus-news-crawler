# HCMUS News Crawler

An automated news crawler that collects announcements from HCMUS websites and publishes them to GitHub Pages.

News are updated hourly at [NEWS.md](https://dihy16.github.io/hcmus-news-crawler/NEWS)

Modified from [huytrinhm/HCMUS-news-crawler](https://github.com/huytrinhm/hcmus-news-crawler), mostly extending the original project by adding support for the [fetel](https://fetel.hcmus.edu.vn/tin-tuc-thong-bao/) page.
